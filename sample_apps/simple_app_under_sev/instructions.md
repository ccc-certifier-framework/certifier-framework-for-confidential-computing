# Simple App under AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)

This example app shows all the major steps in a Confidential Computing program,
running under AMD SEV-SNP.

This document gives
[detailed instructions](#Steps-to-build-and-run-Simple-App-under-AMD-SEV-SNP)
 for building and running the sample application on the
[AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html)
(AMD-SEV) platform using
[AMD Secure Nested Paging](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/SEV-SNP-strengthening-vm-isolation-with-integrity-protection-and-more.pdf)
(SEV-SNP).

The work instructions in this document assume that you have an AMD SEV-SNP-enabled
host configured and an encrypted SNP-VM ready for development.
Refer to the
[section further below](#General-notes-on-building-and-running-an-SEV-enabled-VM-under-KVM)
for detailed instructions on how-to build and run an SEV-enableed VM under KVM.

You can try out the instructions given below to build-and-run a simple app inside
this AMD SNP-SEV VM.
This uses the same application as in [simple_app](../simple_app/example_app.cc).
This example embeds the policy key in the application using the
`embed_policy_key.exe`.

## Simulated SEV-SNP Environment

We also support a SEV-SNP simulator which can be configured and installed
on any Linux host / VM. The steps to build and install the simulator and to
build-and-run the sample app under the simulator are documented below.

----

# Steps to build-and-run Simple App under AMD SEV-SNP

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE is the top level directory for the certifier repository.
It is helpful to have a shell variable for it, e.g.,:

```shell
export CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE=~/Projects/certifier-framework-for-confidential-computing
```

$EXAMPLE_DIR is this directory containing the example application.  Again, a
shell variable is useful.

```shell
export EXAMPLE_DIR=$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/sample_apps/simple_app_under_sev
```
## Setup Software

In order to use the Automatic Policy Generator, you need to use AMD provided
[sev-guest](https://github.com/AMDESE/sev-guest/tree/main) utility to generate
the [SEV-policy JSON](sev_policy.json) file specific for the SEV-SNP platform
you are using.

The [Use Automated Policy Generator](#Step-8-Use-Automated-Policy-Generator) step
of this exercise expects that the user will provide a fully-specified JSON policy
file for their platform on which this test will be run. The following files
will need to be pre-populated in the `simple_app_under_sev/platform_data/`
directory before running these commands:

- sev_policy.json
- ark_cert.der
- ask_cert.der
- vcek_cert.der

See [platform_data/README.md](./platform_data/README) for more details.

## SEV-SNP Simulator utility

There is a Linux driver in the `sev-snp-simulator/` directory that simulates
the SEV functions.

Portions of this code are GPL licensed and the build driver is also GPL licensed.
This is the only directory that contains GPL licensed code and it is not included in
the Certifier API or Certifier Service, so all other code in the Certifier Framework
for Confidential Computing is not affected by GPL license terms.

To build this and install it on Linux:

```shell
$ cd $(CERTIFIER)/sev-snp-simulator
$ make
$ make keys
$ make insmod
$ cd $(CERTIFIER)/sev-snp-simulator/test
$ make sev-test
$ sudo ./sev-test        # (You must be root to run the test)
```

**NOTE**: The [run_example.sh](../run_example.sh) script does not perform this one-time
          setup. You need to do this step before running that script.

-----
## Step 1: Build the utilities
```shell
cd $CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities

make -f cert_utility.mak clean
make -f cert_utility.mak
make -f policy_utilities.mak
```

## Step 2:  Create a directory for the provisioning files
```shell
mkdir $EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning
```

## Step 3: Generate the policy key and self-signed certificate
```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/cert_utility.exe       \
      --operation=generate-policy-key                 \
      --policy_key_output_file=policy_key_file.bin    \
      --policy_cert_output_file=policy_cert_file.bin
```

### Step 3(a): Use der-encoded versions of the certificates

Make sure there are der-encoded versions of the ARK, ASK and VCEK certificates in
the provisioning directory.  For SEV, these certificates come from the platform.

The script provides an alternate way to compile the application in a simulated
evironment provided by sev-snp-simulator.

For that simulated environment, the compilation script,
[sev_example_app.mak](./sev_example_app.mak), supports passing-in `-DSEV_DUMMY_GUEST`
via the `CFLAGS` env-variable.

To test against this environment, you must generate an ARK, ASK and VCEK certificates
that are compatible with the sev-snp-simulator keys.

To do this:

```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/simulated_sev_key_generation.exe            \
         --ark_der=sev_ark_cert.der                                        \
         --ask_der=sev_ask_cert.der                                        \
         --vcek_der=sev_vcek_cert.der                                      \
         --vcek_key_file=/etc/certifier-snp-sim/ec-secp384r1-pub-key.pem

# Save existing cert.der files as .old files
$ for der in ark_cert.der ask_cert.der vcek_cert.der; do cp -p ${der} ${der}.old; done

# cp over newly created sev*.der files as cert.der files
$ for der in ark_cert.der ask_cert.der vcek_cert.der; do cp -p sev_${der} ${der}; done
```

# RESOLVE: This comment seems wrong ... fix it.
**NOTE:** You must run the applications below as root for the simulated enclave.
        Make sure the keys come from
        $CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/src/ec-secp384r1-pub-key.pem and not from the simulator.

## Step 4: Embed the policy key in the example_app
```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/embed_policy_key.exe     \
        --input=policy_cert_file.bin                    \
        --output=../policy_key.cc
```

## Step 5: Compile SEV-example_app with the embedded policy_key
```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR

make -f sev_example_app.mak clean
make -f sev_example_app.mak
```

NOTE: If you are running in a SEV-simulated environment, do:
```shell
CFLAGS='-DSEV_DUMMY_GUEST' make -f sev_example_app.mak
```
## Step 6: Obtain the measurement of the trusted application for this security domain

```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/measurement_init.exe   \
        --mrenclave=<HASH>                            \
        --out_file=example_app.measurement
```
Replace <HASH> with your actual measurement from `sev-snp-measure`.

If you are using the [sev-snp-simulator](./../../INSTALL.md), use:

```
010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708
```


## Author the policy for the security domain and produce the signed claims the apps need

The policies can be generated either manually or through the Policy Generator tool.
In the steps below, follow either step (7), below, or step (8),
[Use Automated Policy Generator](#Step-8-Use-Automated-Policy-Generator).

## Step 7: Manual policy generation

### b. Construct policyKey says platformKey is-trusted-for-attestation

```shell
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_unary_vse_clause.exe    \
        --certificate-subject=ark_cert.der                  \
        --verb="is-trusted-for-attestation"                 \
        --output=ts1.bin

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_indirect_vse_clause.exe     \
        --key_subject=policy_key_file.bin                       \
        --verb="says"                                           \
        --clause=ts1.bin                                        \
        --output=vse_policy1.bin
```

### b. Produce the signed claims for each vse policy statement.

```shell
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_signed_claim_from_vse_clause.exe    \
        --vse_file=vse_policy1.bin                                      \
        --duration=9000                                                 \
        --private_key_file=policy_key_file.bin                          \
        --output=signed_claim_1.bin
```

### c. Construct the measurement policy
```shell
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_unary_vse_clause.exe    \
        --key_subject=""                                    \
        --measurement_subject=example_app.measurement   \
        --verb="is-trusted"                                 \
        --output=ts2.bin

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_indirect_vse_clause.exe     \
        --key_subject=policy_key_file.bin                       \
        --verb="says"                                           \
        --clause=ts2.bin                                        \
        --output=vse_policy2.bin

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_signed_claim_from_vse_clause.exe    \
        --vse_file=vse_policy2.bin                                      \
        --duration=9000                                                 \
        --private_key_file=policy_key_file.bin                          \
        --output=signed_claim_2.bin
```

### d. Construct the trusted platform policy

```shell
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_property.exe    \
        --property_name=debug                       \
        --property_type='string' comparator="="     \

        --int_value=0x03000000000008115             \
        --output=property6.bin

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/combine_properties.exe   \
      --in=property1.bin,property2.bin,property3.bin,property4.bin,property5.bin,property6.bin \
      --output=properties.bin

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_platform.exe    \
        --platform_type=amd-sev-snp                 \
        --properties_file=properties.bin            \
        --output=platform.bin

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_unary_vse_clause.exe    \
        --platform_subject=platform.bin                     \
        --verb="has-trusted-platform-property"              \
        --output=ts3.bin

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_indirect_vse_clause.exe     \
        --key_subject=policy_key_file.bin                       \
        --verb="says"                                           \
        --clause=ts3.bin                                        \
        --output=vse_policy3.bin

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_signed_claim_from_vse_clause.exe    \
        --vse_file=vse_policy3.bin                                      \
        --duration=9000                                                 \
        --private_key_file=policy_key_file.bin                          \
        --output=signed_claim_3.bin
```

### e. Package the policy for the certifier
```shell
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/package_claims.exe                           \
        --input=signed_claim_1.bin,signed_claim_2.bin,signed_claim_3.bin    \
        --output=policy.bin
```

### f. [optional] Print the policy
```shell
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/print_packaged_claims.exe --input=policy.bin
```
## Step 8: Use Automated Policy Generator

NOTE: You have to implement either one of step (7) or this step (8).

### a. Edit policy file

Open sev_policy.json and replace trusted measurements in the
"measurements" property with the expected measurement.

If you are using the sev-snp-simulator, use:

```
010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708
```

**NOTE:** The default [sev_policy.json](./sev_policy.json) provided in this repo
      is custom-crafted to specify the policy and measurement for the SEV-SNP
      test machine internally used.
The  [run_example.sh](../run_example.sh#:~:text=get_measurement_of_trusted_simple_app_under_sev)
script expects that the user will provide a fully-specified JSON file for
their platform on which this test will be run.


### b. Build the Policy Generator

```shell
cd $CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities
LOCAL_LIB=/usr/local/lib64 make -f policy_generator.mak
```

### c. Run Policy Generator:

```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/policy_generator.exe                         \
        --policy_input=../sev_policy.json                                   \
        --schema_input=$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/policy_schema.json    \
        --util_path=$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities
```

### d. [optional] Print the policy
```shell
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/print_packaged_claims.exe --input=policy.bin
```

## Step 8: Build SimpleServer:

You should have gotten the protobuf compiler (protoc) for go when you got go.
If not:

```shell
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
```
Compile the protobuf
```shell
cd $CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/certifier_service/certprotos

protoc --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go_out=. --go_opt=M=certifier.proto ./certifier.proto
```
Compile the oelib for OE host verification
```shell
cd $CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/certifier_service/oelib

make
```
If you do not have OE SDK installed or do not want to enable OE:
```shell
make dummy
```

This should produce a Go file for the certifier protobufs called certifier.pb.go in certprotos.

Now build simpleserver:
```shell
cd $CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/certifier_service

go build simpleserver.go
```


## Step 9: Create directories for app data and service data
```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR
mkdir app1_data app2_data service
```

## Step 10: Provision the app files

Note: These files are required for the "simulated-enclave" which cannot measure the
example app and needs a provisioned attestation key and platform certificate.  On real
hardware, these are not needed.

```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning

cp -p ./* $EXAMPLE_DIR/app1_data
cp -p ./* $EXAMPLE_DIR/app2_data
```


## Step 11: Provision the service files
```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning

cp -p policy_key_file.bin policy_cert_file.bin policy.bin $EXAMPLE_DIR/service
cp -p *.der $EXAMPLE_DIR/service
```


## Step 12: Start the Certifier Service
  In a new terminal window:
```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR/service
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/certifier_service/simpleserver \
      --policyFile=policy.bin                       \
      --readPolicy=true
```


## Step 13:  Run the apps and get admission certificates from Certifier Service

Open two new terminals (one for the app as a client and one for the app as a server):

In app-as-a-client terminal run the following:
```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR

$EXAMPLE_DIR/sev_example_app.exe            \
        --data_dir=./app1_data/             \
        --operation=cold-init               \
        --policy_store_file=policy_store    \
        --print_all=true

$EXAMPLE_DIR/sev_example_app.exe            \
        --data_dir=./app1_data/             \
        --operation=get-certified           \
        --policy_store_file=policy_store    \
        --print_all=true
```

In app-as-a-server terminal run the following:
```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR

$EXAMPLE_DIR/sev_example_app.exe            \
        --data_dir=./app2_data/             \
        --operation=cold-init               \
        --policy_store_file=policy_store    \
        --print_all=true

$EXAMPLE_DIR/sev_example_app.exe            \
        --data_dir=./app2_data/             \
        --operation=get-certified           \
        --policy_store_file=policy_store    \
        --print_all=true
```

At this point, both versions of the app have their admission certificates.
You can look at the output of the terminal running simpleserver for output.

Now all we have to do is have the apps connect to each other for the final test.
The Certifier Service is no longer needed at this point.

## Step 14:  Run the apps to test trusted services

In app-as-a-server terminal run the following:
```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR

$EXAMPLE_DIR/sev_example_app.exe            \
        --data_dir=./app2_data/             \
        --operation=run-app-as-server       \
        --policy_store_file=policy_store    \
        --print_all=true
```

In app-as-a-client terminal run the following:
```shell
cd $EXAMPLE_DIR

$EXAMPLE_DIR/sev_example_app.exe            \
        --data_dir=./app1_data/             \
        --operation=run-app-as-client       \
        --policy_store_file=policy_store    \
        --print_all=true
```

You should see the message "Hi from your secret server" in the client terminal
window and "Hi from your secret client".

If so, **your first Confidential Computing program using AMD SEV-SNP worked!**

## General notes on building and running an SEV-enabled VM under KVM

This section of the document gives some general instructions to configure and
setup an SEV-SNP enabled KVM and a compatible guest kernel.

As it stand today (_circa_ Oct. 2022), you will need to prepare the following
components to have SEV-SNP VMs under KVM:

  - Server BIOS/Firmware update to support SEV-SNP
  - AMD SEV firmware update if necessary
  - Linux kernel build with SNP support (for both the host and the guest)
  - Build the SNP enabled virtual firmware for the guest OS (OVMF)
  - Build the SNP enabled QEMU
  - Build guest and host SEV tools
  - A prepared guest disk image if desired

You first need to make sure your EPYC 7xx3 (or newer) server BIOS is updated to
the newest version with SNP support. This heavily depends on your server
vendor. But they should provide all the tools required for the job.

Once you have the newest BIOS/Firmware, you should see some processor settings
in the BIOS similar to:

- SEV-ES ASID space limit
- SEV SNP memory coverage

Set the ES limit and enable SNP memory coverage or reservation. The terms would
be different for different servers. The way to know whether you have enabled
the hardware properly is to boot the host with a Linux kernel with SNP support
and do the following:

```shell

You need to make sure you have the Reverse Map (RMP) table reserved and
SEV-SNP supported in the log. Otherwise, you missed something in the platform
configuration.

You might also need to update the SEV firmware. You should do this if you know
the firmware version is too low. Follow the instructions at:
https://github.com/AMDESE/AMDSEV/tree/sev-snp-devel#upgrade-sev-firmware

AMD helps with all the software and tools building steps with some scripts.
Make sure you clone it from: https://github.com/AMDESE/AMDSEV.git

Make sure you switch to the "sev-snp-devel" branch. Follow the instructions in
the README and you are supposed to have everything ready. However, we encountered
several issues during the process. Hopefully these will be fixed by the time of
your attempt. Eventually, AMD will upstream all this SEV-SNP support to
Linux/QEMU/OVMF, etc. so that none of the building-from-the-sources steps are
necessary.

Most of the errors you will encounter are related to environment setup. When
the error log is clear, nothing can't be solved with a couple of Google
searches. However, due to how OVMF is built, you might encounter errors with
misleading messages. If you do encounter problems building OVMF with SNP
support, first make sure you have both IASL and NASM installed on your build
system. When the error occurs and you are at a loss, you should at least be
able to see the command failed.

You can manually retry the command after setting the EDK environment manually.
For instance:

```shell
$ cd AMDSEV/ovmf

$ . ./edksetup.sh

$ nice build -v --cmd-len=64436 -DDEBUG_ON_SERIAL_PORT=TRUE -n 256 -t GCC5 -a X64 -p OvmfPkg/OvmfPkgX64.dsc
```

This should give you more helpful info. If you encounter any errors with NASM
complaining about new x86 instructions, remember to build and install the
newest version of NASM. The one that comes with your Linux distro might be too
old.

When following the AMD script, if you have problems building the kernel,
or while generating the ramdisk or if you need special kernel configurations,
you can always build your own.

Clone the AMD Linux kernel source at: https://github.com/AMDESE/linux.git
Switch to the newest SNP branch. Currently, sev-snp-5.19-rc5 would do.

Copy your host config to the source:

```shell
$ cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
```

Sift through the configuration differences and double check the SEV-related ones:

```shell
$ make oldconfig
$ make menuconfig
```

Compile the kernel and generate the deb packages:

```shell
$ make -j `getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`
$ make -j deb-pkg LOCALVERSION=-custom
```

Whatever problems you encounter here should be straight-forward enough to fix.
You should have the following packages ready for install with `dpkg` after
everything is done:

```shell
linux-headers-5.19.0-rc5-next-20220706-custom_5.19.0-rc5-next-20220706-custom-4_amd64.deb
linux-image-5.19.0-rc5-next-20220706-custom_5.19.0-rc5-next-20220706-custom-4_amd64.deb
linux-image-5.19.0-rc5-next-20220706-custom-dbg_5.19.0-rc5-next-20220706-custom-4_amd64.deb
linux-libc-dev_5.19.0-rc5-next-20220706-custom-4_amd64.deb
```

Their identities should be self-explanatory. If you need to update the ramdisk,
you can do it after installing the linux-image-xxx package.

After the installation is done, create `/etc/modprobe.d/kvm.conf` and add the
following line to it:

```shell
options kvm_amd sev-snp=1 sev=1 sev-es=1
```

Reboot your host Linux and verify SNP is ready. Try the dmesg above first and
do the following. Make sure you see the 'Y'.
```shell
$ cat /sys/module/kvm_amd/parameters/sev_snp
Y
```

You should also be able to see the SEV device on the host at /dev/sev. Now you
should have host, kernel, QEMU, and OVMF ready.

The last thing to do on the host is to install sev-tool and retrieve the
platform certificates.

Clone the sev-tool source at: https://github.com/AMDESE/sev-tool.git

Follow the instructions and build the tool. Usage is also included in the
README. However, if for some reason you encountered some buffer overflow during
the certificate retrieval, try applying the following patch:

```shell
--- a/src/sevcore_linux.cpp
+++ b/src/sevcore_linux.cpp
@@ -680,7 +680,7 @@ int SEVDevice::generate_vcek_ask(const std::string output_folder,
    int cmd_ret = SEV_RET_UNSUPPORTED;
    int ioctl_ret = -1;
    sev_user_data_get_id id_buf;
-    char cmd[235];
+    char cmd[512];
    std::string fmt;
    std::string output = "";
    std::string der_cert_w_path = output_folder + vcek_der_file;
```

Hopefully it will be fixed by the time of your attempt.

The next step is to create a guest. You do this as:
- Follow the general KVM/QEMU tutorial.
- After the guest is installed, install the guest linux
  kernel/header/libc packages in the guest.
- Locate your disk image at `/var/lib/libvirt/images`.

And it is time to launch your guest. Go to your AMDSEV repo and do the following:

```shell
$ ./launch-qemu.sh -hda /var/lib/libvirt/images/your_disk_image.qcow2 -sev-snp
```

To get networking and VNC, we recommend updating the script to fix the options
(expecting some familiarity with what you are doing).
Here is just a reference:

```shell
add_opts "-netdev user,id=vmnic,hostfwd=tcp::8000-:22 -device e1000,netdev=vmnic,romfile="
add_opts "-monitor pty -monitor unix:monitor,server,nowait -vnc :0"
```

If you encountered problems with accessing `/dev/sev`, make sure your SeLinux
or AppArmor is configured with proper permissions or just disable them. You
should be able to check these potential permission problems in dmesg.

If the guest boots successfully, you should be able to see the /dev/sev-guest
device and the corresponding SEV-related messages in the guest OS kernel log:

```shell
$ dmesg | grep -i SEV
[    0.185529] Memory Encryption Features active: AMD SEV SEV-ES SEV-SNP
[    0.324674] SEV: Using SNP CPUID table, 31 entries present.

```

### Measuring an SEV kernel and initram

The easiest way to measure your SNP VM is using the open source
SEV-SNP-MEASUREMENT tool from IBM. You can clone the project from here:
https://github.com/IBM/sev-snp-measure.git

```shell
$ sev-snp-measure --help
usage: sev-snp-measure [-h] [--version] [-v] --mode {sev,seves,snp} [--vcpus N]
                       [--vcpu-type CPUTYPE] [--vcpu-sig VALUE] [--vcpu-family FAMILY]
                       [--vcpu-model MODEL] [--vcpu-stepping STEPPING] --ovmf PATH [--kernel PATH]
                       [--initrd PATH] [--append CMDLINE] [--output-format {hex,base64}]
```

You should use 'snp' for the mode option. N is the number of vcpus you
allocated for your SNP VM. You can also check it inside the VM. Instead of
using vcpu-sig / vcpu-family / vcpu-model / vcpu-stepping combinations, you
can use vcpu-type for the input. This is the vcpu type you specified when
you start your VM. You can check `/proc/cpuinfo` inside the guest too.

The `--ovmf` option is used to provide the OVMF firmware image of your VM if
you are booting with OVMF. Otherwise, you can use `--kernel` / `--initrd` /
`--append` to specify kernel image, initrd image, and kernel boot parameters.
You can get your guest boot parameters by reading `/proc/cmdline`.

If you used the launch-qemu.sh script from AMD, you are booting the VM using
OVMF. The kernel and initrd are all on the disk image. In this case, you can
get the measurement of your VM by issuing the following:
```shell
$ ./sev-snp-measure.py --mode snp --vcpus=4 --vcpu-type=EPYC-v4 --ovmf=usr/local/share/qemu/OVMF_CODE.fd
```

The output will match the measurement field in the attestation report from your
SEV-SNP firmware.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Additional comments

When deploying a SEV-enabled  application, the application and all the libraries
it needs should be provisioned into initram.  If you are using the application
service under SEV, the application service and all the libraries it
needs should be provisioned into initram.

## Further notes on attestation in AMD-SEV

Here is the sev attestation structure and supporting data structures:

```
union tcb_version {
  struct {
    uint8_t boot_loader;
    uint8_t tee;
    uint8_t reserved[4];
    uint8_t snp;
    uint8_t microcode;
  };
  uint64_t raw;
};
```

We decode the folllowing from the attestation report:

- single-socket:  bit 4 in the policy byte
- debug: bit 3 in policy byte
- migrate: bit 2 in policy byte
- smt: but 1 in policy mask
- abi-majori: byte 2 in 64 bit policy
- abi-minor: byte 1 in 64 bit policy
- tcb-version:  We currently record this as the 64 bit raw value.

If any of these properties is not specified in the "trused-platform-property", any
value works.

Other values in the report that we may want to inspect, in the future are:

- TSME: TSME enablement status on the platform. From PLATFORM_INFO in the report.
- FAMILY_ID/IMAGE_ID: Provided at launch.
- VMPL: The request VMPL for this report.
- REPORT_ID/REPORT_ID_MA: Report ID of guest and migration agent.
- CHIP_ID: If MaskChipId is set to 0, Identifier unique to the chip. This may be useful
   for revocation when a chip is reported as broken.
