Writing a CC app with the Certifier Framework
=============================================


The example app shows all the major steps in a Confidential Computing Program.
These steps are made much simpler by the Certifier API as indicated in
instructions.txt.

For the Certifier Service
-------------------------
  1. Generate all the keys and the self signed policy cert:
      This is done by the cert_utility.exe.
      The cert utility also generates support keys for the simulated-enclave.
  2. Measure the app:  This is done by measurement_utility.exe.
  3. Author the policy: See step 7 in instructions.txt.
  4. Build the service: See step 8 in instructions.txt.
  5. Create and provision the service data: Setps 9-13 in instructions.txt.
  6. Run the service: Step 13 instructions.txt.


For the Application
-------------------

  1. Embed the policy key: This is done by embed_policy_key.exe using th self-signed
      policy cert from the Certifier Service.
  2. Isolate and measure the program
  
  Subsequent steps are simplified using the cc_trust_data class in cc_helpers.cc
    3. Generate application keys and store them: This is done by cold_start.
    4. Get certified and store cert:  This is done by certify_me(const string& host_name, int port).
    5. Recover Data: This is done in warm_restart.
    6. Open a secure channel to send data.
        The socket and SSL routines in cc_helpers.cc help set up the mutually
        authenticated secure channel.  The channel management is done in the application.
          run_me_as_server in the example how to do this when the app acts as a server.
            The actual (quite simple) transaction is done in server_application.
          run_me_as_client in the example, shows how to do the client side of the channel.
            The actual (quite simple) transaction is done in client_application.
