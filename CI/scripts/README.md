# CI Scripts

This directory contains a collection of setup-type scripts that install
pre-requisite software components needed by different parts of the
Certifier build-and-test system.

Most of these are invoked as part of CI, under
[build.yml](../../.github/workflows/build.yml).

All tests that are run as part of CI can be executed on your development
environment using the [test.sh](./test.sh) script.
